Software development is more like surgery than playing with LEGOs. This gruesome [comparison](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/02/03/lego-blocks-and-organ-transplants/) from 2011 still rings true today:

> People have been comparing software components to LEGO blocks for a couple decades. We should be able to assemble applications by snapping together modular components, just like LEGOs. There has been progress, but for the most part we haven’t realized the promise LEGO-style software development.

> Integrating two software systems is usually more like performing a heart transplant than snapping together LEGO blocks. It can be done—if there’s a close enough match and the people doing it have enough skill—but the pieces don’t fit together trivially. And failure may not be immediately obvious; it may take a while to see signs of rejection.

With the drastic growth of open source over the past ten years, one would think we have access to more LEGO blocks today than ever before.

But in many ways it feels like building a sustainable software product is harder than ever.

This is because open source software is less like functional LEGO blocks and more like mechanical blueprints.

To creating a healthy and thriving software system, one must instantiate, integrate, grow, and maintain a complex constellation of constituent parts.

Bodies need brains, hearts, and lungs to live, and software systems require their own vital components, like databases, servers, and caches.

There is major effort between choosing a stack of blueprints and integrating them into a robust system.

Software upstarts are at a disadvantage to established incumbents given the high mortality rate of immature systems.

Traditional software systems are also independent organisms. They suffer from inefficiency by requiring redundancy and repetitive work to create the foundational organs.

The beauty of crypto is that software engineers no longer have to grow and transplant software "organs" from scratch.

They can tap into an ecosystem of living software components running on a shared superorganism.

Instead of independent bodies supporting their own vital organs, a blockchain is a single computational substrate shared between multiple applications.

A blockchain network is a superorganism where vital resources are shared.

Ethereum is the host (body) comprised of a diverse ecosystem of applications (organs).

Since all applications are written in the same language and run on a shared virtual machine, there are no problems of organ rejection by design, other than your typical bugs.

Unlike the cold schematics of open source code, blockchain components beat like a heart.

The body's subsystems can outsource functionality and take advantage of blood rushing from the heart. So can blockchain developers benefit from running components (organs) deployed by others, without having to grow things from scratch.
