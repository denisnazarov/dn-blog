The traditional software development process is more like surgery than playing with LEGOs.

This [comparison](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/02/03/lego-blocks-and-organ-transplants/) from 2011 still rings true today:

> People have been comparing software components to LEGO blocks for a couple decades. We should be able to assemble applications by snapping together modular components, just like LEGOs. There has been progress, but for the most part we haven’t realized the promise of LEGO-style software development.

> Integrating two software systems is usually more like performing a heart transplant than snapping together LEGO blocks. It can be done—if there’s a close enough match and the people doing it have enough skill—but the pieces don’t fit together trivially. And failure may not be immediately obvious; it may take a while to see signs of rejection.

With the compounding growth of open source software over the past ten years, today we have access to more software LEGOs than ever.

But building a software product is still a long way from the simplicity of working with a plastic construction toy.

In practice, open source code is more like a blueprint or schematic than a functioning component. The code still needs to be deployed by a programmer and sustained throughout its life.

Let’s extend the biological metaphor of an organ system to illuminate this point. Bodies need brains, hearts, and lungs to live.

Software systems likewise require their own vital components, like databases, servers, and caches.

To creating a healthy and thriving software system, one must instantiate, incubate, integrate, grow, and maintain a complex constellation of “living” subsystems, similar to a body.

Organisms develop through physical growth and interactions with their environment. Software systems also develop and grow—by accumulating data from their users and by being maintained by developers.

Having an independent brain, heart, and lungs is a biological necessity for an animal, but for a software system it is inefficient and redundant.

Dramatically different software products can serve drastically different purposes, but they are all comprised of primarily the same core building blocks.

The burden of recreating an independent “body” also puts new software products at a disadvantage to established products with more "mature" components. Immature systems have a higher mortality risk.

What makes blockchain systems different?

The beauty of blockchains is that software engineers no longer have to grow or transplant new software "organs" from scratch.

They can tap into an ecosystem of living software components running on a shared superorganism.

Take Ethereum. The blockchain is the host (body) comprised of a diverse ecosystem of apps (organs).

Newly built apps can tap into the functionality of existing apps deployed by other developers, since all applications share the same computational substrate. (The open permission model of blockchains is crucial for frictionless sharing of resources and components.)

Since all applications are written in the same language and run in a shared computational environment, there are by definition no issues of organ rejection (other than typical bugs).

This new paradigm makes open source code look like lifeless blueprints. Blockchain components, on the other hand, beat like hearts, breathe like lungs, and think like brains.

In a mammal, body's subsystems gain in efficiency and can specialize by outsourcing functionality and taking advantage of existing subsystems.

Blockchain developers can likewise benefit from existing components deployed by others, without having to grow things from scratch.
