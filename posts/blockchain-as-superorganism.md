The traditional software development process is more like surgery than playing with LEGOs.

This [comparison](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/02/03/lego-blocks-and-organ-transplants/) from 2011 that recently surfaced on Hacker News still rings true today:

> People have been comparing software components to LEGO blocks for a couple decades. We should be able to assemble applications by snapping together modular components, just like LEGOs. There has been progress, but for the most part we haven’t realized the promise of LEGO-style software development.

> Integrating two software systems is usually more like performing a heart transplant than snapping together LEGO blocks. It can be done—if there’s a close enough match and the people doing it have enough skill—but the pieces don’t fit together trivially. And failure may not be immediately obvious; it may take a while to see signs of rejection.

With the compounding growth of open source software over the past ten years, today we have access to more of what seem like software LEGOs than ever.

But building a software product is still a long way from the holy grail of frictionless, interoperable modularity of off-the-shelf components.

In practice, an open source library is more like a blueprint or schematic than an active component one plugs into. The code still needs to be deployed by a programmer and sustained throughout its life.

Let me try to extend the biological metaphor of a body's organ system and attempt to illuminate the costly life support needed to sustain today's software applications, and then explain how the blockchain model is fundamentally different.

Bodies need brains, hearts, and lungs to live.

Software systems, likewise, require their own vital components—like databases, servers, and caches.

To create a healthy and thriving software system, one must instantiate, incubate, integrate, grow, and maintain a complex constellation of “living” subsystems, similar to a body.

Organisms develop through physical growth and interactions with their environment. Software systems also develop and grow, by accumulating data from their users and by being maintained by developers.

Having an independent brain, heart, and lungs is a biological necessity for an animal. But for a software system, it is actually inefficient and redundant. The overhead increases costs and makes development more difficult.

Different software products can serve drastically different purposes, but they are all comprised of primarily the same core building blocks.

A developer, therefore, has the costly burden of recreating an independent “body” for every new software application. This puts new software products at a disadvantage compared to established products with more "mature" components, since immature systems have a higher mortality risk.

## How are blockchain systems different?

The beauty of blockchains is that software engineers no longer have to each grow an organism from scratch.

They can tap into an ecosystem of living software components running on a shared superorganism.

Take Ethereum. The blockchain is the host (body) comprised of a diverse ecosystem of apps (organs).

Newly built apps can tap into the functionality of existing apps deployed by other developers, since all applications share the same computational substrate.

(The open permission model of blockchains is crucial for frictionless sharing of vital resources and components.)

Since all applications are written in the same programming language and run in a shared computational environment, there is by definition no issue of organ rejection. (Other than typical bugs.)

This new paradigm of reusable open services makes traditional open source code look like lifeless blueprints. Blockchain components beat like hearts, breathe like lungs, and think like brains, and anyone is free to utilize them.

A mammal's shared organ subsystems provide gains in efficiency and allow independent components to specialize by outsourcing functionality. This creating emergent complexity, and in turn unprecedented intelligence and adaptability.

Blockchain developers can likewise benefit from existing components deployed by others, without having to grow things from scratch.

Now this is a software development paradigm that looks a lot more like LEGOs.
